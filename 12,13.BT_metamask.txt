1.  What is Blockchain 
Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger technology that records 
transactions across multiple computers, ensuring transparency and security 
without a central authority. 
2.   What is Cryptocurrency? 
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for 
security, operates on blockchain technology, and enables peer-to-peer 
transactions without intermediaries, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. 
3. What are Transaction Wallets? 
Transaction wallets are digital wallets that store cryptocurrencies and allow 
users to send, receive, and manage their digital assets securely. Examples 
include MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 
4.   What is an Ether Transaction? 
An Ether transaction involves transferring Ether (ETH), the native currency of 
the Ethereum blockchain, between wallets. Transactions are recorded on the 
blockchain and require a small transaction fee. 
5.   
Installation Process of MetaMask 
• Step 1: Go to the MetaMask website or browser extension store. 
• Step 2: Download and install MetaMask for your browser or mobile device. 
• Step 3: Create a new wallet, set up a strong password, and securely store your 
backup phrase. 
• Step 4: Once set up, MetaMask is ready to manage Ether and other Ethereum
based assets. 
6.  What Are the Different Types of Blockchain Technology? 
• Public Blockchain: Open to everyone (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). 
• Private Blockchain: Restricted access for specific users. 
• Consortium Blockchain: Controlled by a group of organizations. 
• Hybrid Blockchain: Combines public and private features for flexibility. 
7.  What Are the Key Features/Properties of Blockchain? 
• Decentralization: No central authority; data is spread across nodes. 
• Transparency: Transactions are visible to all participants. 
• Immutability: Data cannot be altered once added to the blockchain. 
• Security: Cryptographic techniques secure data and transactions. 
8. What is the Difference Between Ethereum and Bitcoin? 
• Bitcoin: Primarily a digital currency for secure payments. 
• Ethereum: A platform for creating decentralized applications (dApps) with 
smart contract functionality, in addition to its currency, Ether. 
9. What are Merkle Trees? Explain Their Concept. 
Merkle Trees are a data structure used in blockchain to efficiently and securely 
verify transactions. They organize transaction data into a tree structure, where 
each leaf node is hashed, and hashes are combined up to form a single root 
hash, providing an easy way to verify data integrity. 
10.  Give Real-Life Use Cases of Blockchain. 
• Finance: Cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). 
• Supply Chain: Tracking goods from production to delivery. 
• Healthcare: Secure storage and sharing of patient records. 
• Voting Systems: Transparent and tamper-proof voting records. 
• Digital Identity: Managing digital identities and preventing fraud.

1.     
What is Bitcoin? 
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by an anonymous 
person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on blockchain 
technology, allowing peer-to-peer transactions without the need for 
intermediaries like banks. 
2.   What Are the Biggest Four Common Cryptocurrency Scams? 
Phishing Scams: Fake websites or emails trick users into revealing private 
keys. 
Ponzi Schemes: Fraudulent investment schemes promising high returns. 
Fake ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings): Scammers create fake tokens or projects to 
get investors’ funds. 
Rug Pulls: Developers abandon a project suddenly, taking investors' money. 
3. Explain How Safe Are Money E-Transfers? 
Money e-transfers can be safe when using secure networks and reputable 
services. Encryption and authentication protocols make them secure, but users 
should be cautious of phishing, hacking, or unauthorized access. 
4.   What is Cryptojacking and How Does It Work? 
Cryptojacking is unauthorized use of someone’s computer or device to mine 
cryptocurrency. Attackers install malware or use malicious scripts on websites 
to hijack device resources, slowing down systems and potentially causing 
damage.
